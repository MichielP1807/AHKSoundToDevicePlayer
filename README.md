# AHKSoundToDevicePlayer
A program used to play sounds directly to a audio device, so you can user your virtual audio cables to do live sound effects on when you're in a call or when you're live streaming while playing a game.

This is a autohotkey script to play sounds to a specific device when a hotkey is triggered.

Open soundeffects.ahk in a text editor for more info and to add your own hotkeys with sounds.
