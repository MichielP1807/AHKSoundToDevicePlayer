# AHKSoundToDevicePlayer
A program used to play sounds directly to a audio device activated by a hotkey, so you can user your virtual audio cables to do live sound effects on when you're in a call or when you're live streaming while playing a game.

- Open soundeffects.ahk in a text editor for more info and to add your own hotkeys with sounds
- Make sure to restart the script after changing and saving it!
